# DataRoadMap
It's not HolyQuraan
# First of ALL
"I initially crafted this roadmap with a strong focus on a work mindset, aiming to guide you in making informed decisions about your goals.
Regardless of the specific tools you choose to learn, embracing an analytical mindset holds paramount importance. 
With an analytical mindset, you gain the adaptability to effectively work with any tools at your disposal, 
enabling you to navigate various scenarios that may arise within the company or while engaging with stakeholders."

Creating a data analysis roadmap is an important step in any data analysis project,
as it helps to ensure that you have a clear plan for how you will approach your analysis and what steps you will take to achieve your goals. 
Here are some steps you can follow to deal with stakeholders:
# 1- Define Your Goals: 
Start by defining the goals of your analysis.
What are you trying to accomplish? What questions are you trying to answer?
What insights are you hoping to gain? Make sure your goals are specific and measurable.
and thats the Analysis mindset.

# 2 - Identify Your Data Sources:
Once you have defined your goals, identify the data sources you will need to achieve them.
This may include internal databases, such as ( https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-databases/)
public data sources, or data collected through surveys or experiments.
# 3 - Collect and Clean Your Data: 
Once you have identified your data sources, collect and clean your data.
This may involve merging data from multiple sources,
removing missing or erroneous data, 
and transforming your data into a format that is suitable for analysis.
You can read about every line and some tools for that (Python, SQL, Power Bi, Tableau )
# 4 - Explore Your Data:
With your data cleaned and ready to go, start exploring your data. 
This may involve visualizing your data, calculating summary statistics,and identifying trends and patterns.
 # 5 - Choose Your Analysis Techniques:
based on your data exploration, choose the analysis techniques that will help you achieve your goals.
# 6 - Communicate Your Results:

Tools ( Python, SQL, Power Bi, Tableau ) 
# 7 - Iterate and Refine: 
Finally, iterate and refine your analysis as needed. 
This may involve going back to earlier steps in the process to collect more data, 
refine your analysis techniques, or adjust your goals.
What happens in companies is not as important as the approach you take in dealing with the business owner.
It's essential to understand what questions the business owner has and the nature of the company's operations,rather than the tool you will use.
The tool you will use ultimately depends on the company's nature and the tool they are already using.
